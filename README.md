## (VI) BIG O

### Amortized Time 
[ref.](https://medium.com/@satorusasozaki/amortized-time-in-the-time-complexity-of-an-algorithm-6dd9a5d38045)

When the array in it hasnâ€™t reached its capacity and still has enough space to insert items.

When the array in it has reached its capacity and need to re-create itself with the doubled size.

The insertion takes O(n) when the capacity has been reached, and the amortized time for each insertion is O(1).
